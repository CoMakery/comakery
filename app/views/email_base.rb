  # Quick Tutorial on Structuring Emails
  #
  # We're using Zurb Ink to make structured, responsive emails. Ink doesn't get
  # away from tables (that's still not possible) but it helps you style them.
  #
  # This file has a number of helpers for generating the nested tables that are
  # required.  See the [Zurb docs](http://zurb.com/ink/docs.php) for
  # background, details and more possibilities.
  #
  # For the most part, you can use the `row` and `column` helpers that should
  # be familiar from Views::Base.  They work slightly differently and have some
  # caveats, explained here.
  #
  # 1. Columns do not have small/medium/large variants; their sizes are
  #    spelled-out numbers: *three*, *four*, *six*, *twelve*, etc.  All columns
  #    collapse at 580px.
  # 2. The last column in a row must use the `last_column` helper.
  # 3. Rows are not nestable.  You may want to look at sub-grids (non-
  #    responsive) or block-grids (which collapse according to usual div rules)
  #    if you need something similar to nested rows.
  # 4. The block passed to `column` or `full_row` must return a `td`, or a
  #    series of `td`s if you are using sub-grids.
  #
  # There are also helpers for centering content, creating buttons and creating
  # full-width rows.
  #
  # There are no helpers, yet, for sub-grids, block-grids, panels, retina-
  # images, or hidden content for small screens, though they may all be
  # possible.

CoMakery helps coordinate blockchain missions, projects and token awards.

## Current Implementation Status

This project is in open beta. It is being actively developed by CoMakery.


## Updated Schema

**Summary of changes**

* Add MISSIONS table
* Add TOKENS table
* Migrate token values currently stored in PROJECTS to TOKENS

* AWARDS renamed to TASKS and new fields added
* New tables TASK_SKILLS, SKILLS, and ACCEPTANCE_REQUIREMENTS added

## Configuration

We use Rails localization (i18n) for application-specific language.
Every fork of this project will maintain their own `config/locales/app.yml`.

We use environment variables for app "secrets", and values which vary between environments,
eg staging and production.

## Local development

Prerequisites:

- PostgreSQL
- Redis (if you want to run delayed jobs)
- Bundler
- Yarn
- Chrome and Chromedriver ([Reference setup](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/blob/master/ruby/images/2.4.4-stretch/browsers/Dockerfile))

Set up .env:

```sh
cp .env.dev .env
heroku config -a <YOUR_HEROKU_APP> -s | egrep '^(SLACK_|ETHEREUM_|ETHERCAMP_)' | sort >> .env
```

Basics :

```sh
source .env
bundle install
yarn install
rails db:setup
rails data:migrate
```

Run server:

```sh
rails server
```

or if you want to run with delayed jobs:

```sh
bin/server
```
## React on Rails

* Webpacker
For development, run `bin/webpack-dev-server` command in a terminal separate from `bundle exec rails s` so that the changes made inside react components are updated real time.
However for production, we will use precompiled react code so we don't need to run webpack-dev-server for production mode.
And Webpacker hooks up a new webpacker:compile task to assets:precompile, which gets run whenever you run assets:precompile.
So after running assets precompile, all react components will be working on production mode.

* React_Rails
All react components should be inside app/javascript/components. And you can just use `react_component` helper to render react component and that's all - <%= react_component "Account" %>.

## Running tests

A bit faster `bin/rspec`

More thorough (integrates views): `bin/rspect`

JS tests via Jest: `yarn test`

## Pushing code to Github

To run your tests and git push your branch *only if tests pass*, run `bin/shipit`.

## Data migrations

We are using the data-migrate gem to load static table data or transform data. data migrate works similarly to schema migrations - they run in sequence, are run only once, track the last database migration that was run in the database, and can be run with rake.

Data migration scripts are located in `db/data_migrations`. 

If you need to migrate data or add static table data run
```
bundle exec rake data:migrate
```

To generate a new data migration run
```
rails g data_migration add_this_to_that
```

More documentation is [here](https://github.com/ilyakatz/data-migrate)

## Deploying to heroku staging

Once your heroku user has access to the applications, you can run any of:

```
citizen deploy staging master comakery
```

## Deploying to heroku production

Show the down for mmaintainence page, backup the production db and confirm.

```
heroku maintenance:on
heroku pg:backups:capture HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BROWN --app comakery-production
heroku pg:backups --app comakery-production
```

After you have your backup captured, deploy to production:
```
citizen deploy production master comakery
```

The deploy also runs `rake db:migrate` and `heroku maintenance:off --app comakery-poduction`

**TODO:** Fix bin/deploy which calls citizen. It should take more intuitive arguments and give better instructions.
```
bin/deploy staging
bin/deploy production
```

## Basic Auth

Set an environment variable called `BASIC_AUTH` in the format
`<username>:<password>` (e.g., `chewie:r0000ar`). Basic auth will be enabled if
that environment variable exists.

## Deploying to Heroku with app.json
- [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/CoMakery/comakery-app)
- During setup update API keys and secrets according to environment
- After deployment manually update formation and addons plans according to environment
- Re-run migrations using Heroku CLI, if `heroku-postgresql` plan is upgraded from `hobby-dev`
- Setup DNS and install following addons in case of production or staging environment:
  - https://elements.heroku.com/addons/ssl
  - https://elements.heroku.com/addons/expeditedssl
- Update Cloudfront and Airbrake settings

## Sidekiq

Visit <COMAKERY_INSTANCE>/admin/sidekiq

Username admin, password is in heroku app settings

### Scheduled Jobs

On staging and production, we use Heroku Scheduler to run `rails runner bin/patch_ethereum_awards`
on a daily basis.  This task backfills "pending" ethereum awards, if they are no longer retired by Sidekiq.

### Clear and regenerate dead sidekiq jobs

If you are getting an out of memory error for Redis. The processed queue can take up a lot of memory. It can be cleared with `Sidekiq::Stats.new.reset`

If the queue gets backed up or the regenerate script starts duplicating jobs, you can clear it out the Sidekiq job queue by running:

```
Sidekiq::Queue.all.each(&:clear)
Sidekiq::RetrySet.new.clear
Sidekiq::ScheduledSet.new.clear
Sidekiq::Stats.new.reset
Sidekiq::DeadSet.new.clear
```

You can regenerated the jobs manually with:
```
heroku run bundle exec rails runner bin/patch_ethereum_awards --app comakery-staging
```

### Redis Configuration On Heroku

You can find the configuration details at the Heroku Overview Redis To Go link. Notice that this is **redis to go** and **NOT Heroku Redis**. This means that Heroku Redis commands will not work.

You might get an error like `Redis::CommandError: OOM command not allowed when used memory > 'maxmemory'.`

To remove old keys you can do the following. Use the correct environment for your needs.

```
heroku addons -a comakery-staging
```

You will see something like:
```
redistogo (redistogo-spherical-15306)          micro        $5/month   created
 └─ as REDISTOGO
```

More info with:
```
heroku addons:info redistogo-spherical-15306
```

### Flushing Redis Directly

Hopefully you won't need this...

Consider clearing out the Sidekiq Redis jobs using the `Sidekiq::Queue.all.each(&:clear)` and related Sidekiq methods as described in other sections.

You can connect to Redis To Go CLI with:
```
redis-cli -h lab.redistogo.com -p 9968 -a [password]
```

To flush the old keys
```
lab.redistogo.com:9968> flushdb
```

## Github Importer

To create an an award for each git commit in a github project, start by running this command:  
```
importer/git_importer.rb --help                             # local
heroku run -r staging "importer/git_importer.rb --help"     # staging
```

Study the options in help, then construct a command.

**Use only with great care on production!**
If you mistype the project ID, you will import awards into the wrong project.

A full sample command:
```
heroku run -r staging "importer/git_importer.rb --github-repo core-network/client --project-id 1 --ethereum"
```

## Deleting a project

If you want to completely remove all traces of project `p` (be careful):

```ruby
p.award_types.each{|t| t.awards.destroy_all}
p.award_types.destroy_all
p.delete
```

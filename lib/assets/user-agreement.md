You further acknowledge and agree that CoMakery is authorized and instructed to rely upon the information it receives from third parties, including Project Creators and Project Contributors, including information relating to legal and regulatory compliance. Projects Creators and Project Contributors hereby represent and warrant compliance with applicable law with respect to transactions in Coins. CoMakery shall have no responsibility to review, confirm or otherwise assume any duty with respect to regulatory or legal compliance with respect to the underlying transactions in Coins, the Coins themselves or the accuracy or completeness of any data supplied to it by or on behalf of any third parties.

**2.3 Project Creation**. Project Creators may use the CoMakery Site to create projects and project pages ("Projects") on which they describe the project tasks, deliverables, services, and associated terms of completion ("Tasks") and propose Coin Award Transactions for administration through the CoMakery Administration Services. Upon creation, Projects and Tasks will be in a pending state while CoMakery reviews and analyzes the Projects and Tasks and completes any needed identity verification and determines any required technical specification or software development work that needs to be performed in connection with developing Administrative Applications suited for the Projects and the Coin that is sought to be awarded by Project Contributors in Coin Award Transactions and prepares the Order Form. During the pending state period, functionality of CoMakery Administration Services may be limited in CoMakery's sole discretion, and Coin Award Transactions will not be enabled. After CoMakery has reviewed the Projects and Tasks proposed for administration, CoMakery may, in its sole and absolute discretion: (i) accept the Projects and the Tasks, quote applicable fees to the Project Creator on the Order Form, and enable CoMakery Administration Services functionality following the Project Creator's acceptance of the Order Form; (ii) inform Project Creators of what revisions to the Projects or Tasks are required or of any additional information or work needs to be performed prior to enabling CoMakery Administration Services and preparing an Order Form; or (iii) inform Project Creators that their Projects and/or Tasks has not been approved for CoMakery Administration Services.

**2.3 Project Contribution**. Project Contributors may use the CoMakery Site to contribute to Projects by proposing their performance of Tasks pursuant to terms specified by Project Creators in exchange for specified Coin Award Transactions administered through the CoMakery Administration Services. Upon indication of the proposed performance of a Task by Project Contributors, the Tasks proposed to be performed will be in a pending state while the Project Creator reviews the proposed contribution and the Project Contributors who have proposed and offered to perform the Tasks, and, if necessary, CoMakery reviews and analyzes any needed identity verification or performs additional diligence. During the pending state period, functionality of CoMakery Administration Services may be limited and Coin Award Transactions will not be enabled. Project Contributors' offers to complete Tasks will be able accepted and Tasks created by Project Creators will be performable by Project Contributors in exchange for Coin Award Transactions (administered through CoMakery Administrative Services) after the Project Creator has reviewed and accepted the proposed Project Contributor's proposed offer to complete of a Task.

##**3. Administrative Applications.**

**3.1. In General.**  The Administrative Applications allow Project Creators to send their own Coin to Project Contributors and various other administrative functionality, including viewing, tabulating, reporting, requesting, and receiving supported Coins from third parties pursuant to instructions Project Creators and Project Contributors provide through the CoMakery Site (each such transaction is a "Coin Award Transaction"). **CoMakery reserves the right, to the maximum extent technically possible, to limit and/or disable Administrative Applications or use of such Administrative Applications as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order or to enforce transaction limits, but CoMakery cannot reverse a Coin Award Transaction which has been effected on any Coin network's cryptographic blockchain. CoMakery is further limited in its ability to refuse to process transactions because it does not maintain custody or control of Coins awarded though its Administrative Applications (through the storage of private keys or otherwise), and CoMakery only enables the user-directed use of programmatic Administrative Applications. The Administrative Applications services are available only in connection with those Coins and projects that CoMakery, in its sole discretion, decides to support. The Coins that CoMakery supports may change from time to time and are the decision of whether to support the administration of certain Coins is made on the basis of a multi-factor tests, including an evaluation of the Project Creators, the proposed Coin and an evaluation of facts and circumstances relating to the expected distribution of the expected Coin Award Transactions. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use the Administrative Applications services to store, send, request, or receive Coins in any form that are not supported by CoMakery. CoMakery assumes no responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use CoMakery Administration Services for Coins or Coin Award Transactions that CoMakery does not support.**

**3.2. Coin Award Transactions.**  CoMakery Administrative Applications process supported Coin Award Transactions according to the instructions received from its users, and CoMakery does not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to CoMakery Administrative Applications. CoMakery reserves the right to attempt to delay or disable any Coin Award Transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity.

**3.3. Transmission Delays.**  Neither CoMakery nor CoMakery Administrative Applications store the private keys of Coins. As a result, it may be necessary for CoMakery to retrieve certain information from you or for you to supply additional information through the Administrative Applications in order to facilitate a Coin Award Transaction in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such Coin Award Transaction. You acknowledge and agree that a Coin Award Transaction facilitated by CoMakery Administrative Applications may be delayed.

**3.4. Third Party Contributions.**  CoMakery has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party (including any service performed or deliverables delivered in connection with Tasks performed by Project Contributors and Projects and in connection with Tasks created by Project Creators other actions taken by users of CoMakery Administration Services). CoMakery is not responsible for ensuring that a service provider or buyer or a seller you may transact with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services in connection with Coin Award Transaction administered using the CoMakery Administration Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must resolve the dispute directly with that third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify CoMakery Support support@comakery.com so that we may consider what action to take, if any.

**3.5. Customized CoMakery Account Page; User Content.**  CoMakery may permit a user to establish a customizable Project Creator or Project Contributor page ("Account Page") which will allow others to easily view Projects, Tasks or administer Coin Award Transactions to and from your CoMakery Account.

In the event of a fork, you agree that CoMakery may temporarily suspend CoMakery operations and CoMakery Administrative Services (with or without advance notice to you) and that CoMakery may, in its sole discretion, in consultation with Project Creators, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely.

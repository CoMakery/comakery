The _Contributor_ also promises that any work from others that the _Project Owner_ references for download is available, free of charge, under a _Permissive Open-Source License_. Any standard form license approved by the Open Source Initiative or Creative Commons without copyleft or non-commercial-use conditions counts as a **Permissive Open-Source License**.

## No Other Warranties<a id="No_Other_Warranties"></a>

The only warranties the _Contributor_ makes are in [Warranties](#Warranties). The _Contribution_ otherwise comes as-is. None of the warranties the law might otherwise read into this agreement apply.

## Royalties<a id="Royalties"></a>

The license the _Contributor_ gives the _Project Owner_, as well as any sublicenses, apply only if the _Project Owner_ pays **Royalties** under these terms:

1.  The _Project Owner_ agrees to count money customers pay either to license, or to use a hosted instance of, the _Project_ as **Revenue**, starting from the date of this agreement. Money customers pay for consulting, training, custom development, support, and other services related to the _Project_ does not count as _Revenue_.

2.  The _Project Owner_ agrees to pay the _Contributor_ _Royalties_ calculated according to the _Award Form_.

3.  The _Project Owner_ agrees to begin paying _Royalties_ once _Revenue_ reaches the minimum revenue amount on the _Award Form_. After that point, the _Project Owner_ agrees to pay the _Contributor_ _Royalties_ on demand, as long as the _Project Owner_ owes the _Contributor_ at least the minimum payment amount on the _Award Form_.

4.  If the _Project Owner_ licenses, or provides use of a hosted instance of, the _Project_ free of charge for more than 6 calendar months to any customer, the _Project Owner_ agrees to count the amount the customer would have paid for that excess time at its usual rate as _Revenue_. If there is no usual rate to speak of, the _Project Owner_ will use its best guess of the market rate.

## Transparency<a id="Transparency"></a>

The _Project Owner_ promises to report the following information to the _Contributor_ as long as the _Contribution_ is utilized in the _Project_: other contributions to the _Project_, royalties awarded for other contributions, _Revenue_ received, and royalties paid to the _Contributor_ and others.

## Administration<a id="Administration"></a>

The _Contributor_ will request _Royalties_ payments via _CoMakery_. If _CoMakery_ stops providing service or makes a significant, negative change to the quality or terms of its service, the _Project Owner_ may switch to another system.

## Confidentiality<a id="Confidentiality"></a>

### Project Owner Can Disclose<a id="Project_Owner_Can_Disclose"></a>

## NOTE

We are working on a Dynamic Royalty Token license to use for this repository. If you are interested in contributing and receiving revenue distributions for your contributions get in touch. We are iterating on how the model will be structured and need your feedback.

Because legal documents are uh, legally binding we will using a simple copyright until the legal documents are appropriately finalized. You can see drafts of what we are working on prior to us adopting it here:
https://github.com/citizencode/dynamic-royalty-license

The general terms are expected to be:
- free for non-comercial use
- source code is open to modification
- contributors will receive royalty tokens for their contributions
- 7.5% of revenue made from commercial use will be distributed to the contributors in proportion to their royalty tokens
